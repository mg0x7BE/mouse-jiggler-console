## Detectability

It's important to keep in mind that this type of software is detectable. I recommend checking whether its use complies with your company's internal regulations and understanding the potential consequences if this software is detected. In my previous companies, we had screen lock policies, but I personally never hid the fact that I used this type of tool. I simply hate it when screen locking is forced, often after a very short period of time.
